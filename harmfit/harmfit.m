function [h,yy] = harmfit(x,y,n)
%HARMFIT Sinusoidal harmonic curve fitting.
%	H = HARMFIT(X,Y) returns first harmonic amplitude and phase of the data
%	vector Y relative to phase vector X (in radian) in a 3-element vector
%	H = [N,AMP,PHA], so that AMP*COS(N*X + PHA) fits Y.
%
%	HARMFIT(X,Y,N) computes the N'th harmonic. N = 1 stands for fundamental,
%	N = 2 is second harmonic, etc... N can be a scalar or a vector of 
%	positive integers. For example use N = 1:4 to compute the first four
%	harmonics.
%
%	[H,YY] = HARMFIT(...) returns also an evaluation of harmonic curve fit
%	in vector YY (as the sum of harmonics defined in N).
%
%	This is simply the core calculation of discrete Fourier transform.
%	For calculation, HARMFIT uses only real values of X and Y (not NaN) and
%	truncates X (and Y) at the largest 2*PI integer multiple.
%
%	Example:
%	   t = linspace(0,2*pi)';
%	   x = 2*cos(t + pi/2) - cos(3*t) + rand(size(t));
%	   [h,y] = harmfit(t,x,1:4);
%	   display(h)
%	   plot(t,[x,y])
%
%	returns estimations of amplitudes/phases for the first four harmonics.
%	Note that negative amplitudes are fitted with positive value and a PI
%	phase difference.
