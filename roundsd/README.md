# Round with fixed significant digits

## roundsd.m

This little function rounds a number (or the elements of a vector or matrix) towards the nearest number with N significant digits. This is a useful complement to Matlab's ROUND, ROUND10 and ROUNDN (Mapping toolbox), especially when dealing with data with a large variety of order of magnitudes.

## Examples
```matlab
roundsd(0.012345,3) returns 0.0123
roundsd(12345,2) returns 12000
roundsd(12.345,4,'ceil') returns 12.35
```
